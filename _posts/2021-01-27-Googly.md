## Backstory
English is the one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, and still continuing today! Unfortunately, recent studies from the United Nations have concluded that **617 million** youth worldwide lack literacy skills, including an astonishing amount of **750 million** adults remaining illiterate in 2016.

## Overview
Our goal of this project was to thrive on the quality of education and demonstrate how impactful it can be to anyone, especially on young and new learners. We reach this goal by providing a very fun & engaging game, where players learn the English language through clicking / typing activities. Googly also provides sound for the words' proper pronunciation to build upon a stronger foundation.

## Features
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images//googly/home.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Our web application was built using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, again, targeted for ESL learners. The home page consists of a very simple, minimalistic design with a link to our repository. At the top displays our navigation bar, consisting of the Home Page and Game page. Lastly, the bottom of this page shows all our contact information, including all our respective GitHub links.</p>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/googly/game.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>As stated earlier, we designed an innovative and engaging interface that involves clicking / typing activities with over <strong>300+</strong> various words. This idea was inspired by the widely popular mobile game, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/piano-tiles-2-piano-game/id1027688889">Piano Tiles 2â„¢ - Piano Game</a>. Additionally, we implemented additional functionalities such as automated sound pronunciations, speed of word animations for enhanced difficulty, and even confetti animations for every score of 10.</p>
