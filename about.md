Hey there! My name is Jon, and I am finishing up my major in Computing Science with a minor in Psychology (SC) at the University of Alberta. As of recently, I've been intrigued on the concept of Web Development / Design and even back in highschool, I was truly interested on how web applications and sites were being made. 

On a side note, I am also interested in UX / UI Design as I could quite literally spend hours and hours trying to find the best fit whenever I am customizing just about anything.

## Hobbies
To get to know me better, below are just a few hobbies I personally enjoy.

### Ricing Desktops
<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/hobbies/rice_1.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Ricing or R.I.C.E. is a term that originates from the car enthusiast community, which stands for Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements (usually also refers to cars from Japan). Essentially, people would make modifications to their cars, mainly in terms of looks, but wouldn't actually enhance any performance; make them appear faster when it's not.</p>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/hobbies/rice_2.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>In the context of Desktops and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">r/unixporn</a>, it refers to customizing one's desktop using visual improvements, such as icons, apps, or really the entire system. It became a staple in the reddit community where people posted their visually attractive desktops, upgraded beyond the default design. I personally have customized my own back in highschool to my liking, as well as recently in 2020 on my Mac (shown in the 2 images).</p>

### Keeb
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/hobbies/keeb.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
Keeb is another term for keyboard, primarily used in the mechanical keyboard community. Most of the time, I'm usually always on my computer and one of the things I do is type a lot - whether that is gaming, coding, or even just surfing the web. Due to this, I also type relatively fast (Highest: 158 wpm) and so I asked myself, why not just build my own?
